# Script to identify numbers of observations and amounts of time on
# sky for the SCUBA-2 850um Legacy Release r1, categorised by their
# original project types.

# This runs against the jsa_proc database, so will definitely find
# only things we are including in the release.

# Command to run it is:
# cat ~/get_legacyrelease_times.sh | mysql -B -h kamaka jsa_proc -u <username with read access to jsa_proc> -p > legacy_release_times.txt

#If this ever needs to be used again it should really be tidied up.

# SF Graves March 2015.
