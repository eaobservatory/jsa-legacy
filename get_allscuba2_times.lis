# Commands to get time spent in SCUBA-2 Science Observations towards
# non-moving targets, since the start of post-S2SRO observing with 4
# subarrays per waveband.


# There is presumably some way to get SYBASE to process this file
# without copying and pasting into emsql, but isql doesn't appear to
# be working for me and I don't want to bother writing a Perl script
# for a run-once script.

# I run when SCUBA-2 observations have restarted after the march 2015
#  shutdown this will require a utdate <=20150301 to replicate these
#  results.

# requires:
#  use JCMT;
