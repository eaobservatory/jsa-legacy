\begin{abstract}
  We present the second JCMT Legacy Release, consisting of uniform
  reductions, co-additions, and catalogs of detected emission for the
  850\,\um\ data from all SCUBA-2 observations taken between 2011
  February 2 and 2015 March 1. The data are gridded onto HEALPix tiles
  of $~$1 degree a side, using the HPX projection with pixels of area
  3.22 by 3.22 arcseconds. The individually reduced observations
  include 6420 hours of observing time, and the co-added tiles used
  5915 hours of this, covering 1356 square degrees of the sky. The
  co-adds have been calibrated into units of m\jyas\ using a
  self-derived flux conversion factor. Contiguous regions of emission
  were detected at a better than 5-$\sigma$ level in 740 tiles,
  covering in total 1.4 square degrees, or 0.33 percent of the
  co-added area. Within this area, 13477 local maxima were
  detected. Sixteen of the co-added tiles contain regions with a noise
  better than 1\,m\jybm.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
% JCMT & SCUBA-2 & JSA
The JCMT is a 15-m submillimetre telescope located at an altitude of
4092\,m on Maunakea, where it has been operating since 1987. Its
current instrument suite includes SCUBA-2, a 10,000-pixel continuum
camera that observes simultaneously at 450\,\um\ and 850\,\um\
wavelengths \citep{Holland2013}, and has been operating in full
science mode since 2011.  % JCMT Principal Investigator (PI)
% observations, including
% those taken with SCUBA-2, usually become public a year after the end
% of the semester they are taken in. These public observations are already
% available to download as raw and pipeline-reduced files from the
% JCMT Science Archive (JSA) \citep{2015Economou}, at the Canadian
% Astronomy Data Centre (CADC). However, these products do not include
% full co-adds of all data taken towards a region, and different projects
% may use very different reduction methods and should not be
% naively co-added.

% why this release
To maximise the scientific return of these many years of archival
data, and to make it as easy as possible for non-submm-experts to use
the JCMT data, the Joint Astronomy Centre, then-operators of the JCMT,
decided to produce `legacy' reductions of all public data from the
current instrumentation. This work has been continued since 2015 March
by East Asian Observatory, the current operators of the JCMT. These
legacy reductions are envisioned as providing a uniform, standardized
reduction, co-addition, and emission detection of all publicly
available observations, regularly updated as more observations become
public. The aim has been to produce uniformly reduced high-quality
co-added maps that required as little checking as possible by hand,
and which would allow astronomers to easily discover which regions
have been observed, the noise levels in existing regions, and where
there are clear detections. Previously, the SCUBA Legacy Catalogue
\citep{DiFrancesco2008} presented uniformly reduced co-adds and
catalogs of all SCUBA data, and this resource has been very widely
used, both in scientific publications and as a first step for
interested users. The first legacy release (LR1) was made public in
the JCMT Science Archive in 2015, and included 850\micron\ SCUBA-2
data from 2011 February 2 to 2013 August 1. This paper presents the
expanded and updated LR2 release including SCUBA-2 850\micron\ data
from 2011 February 2 to 2015 March 1st. Planned future releases are
the 450\,\um\ SCUBA-2 observations and HARP spectral cubes, as well as
regular updates to the 850\,\um\ release.


% % Release of block 1 and these data
% This release includes data taken from 2011 February 2 to 2015 March
% 1st, when the JCMT was began to be operated by East Asian Observatory.
% The first block of these data, from 2011 to 2013 August 1 was already
% reduced and publicly released in September 2015. This release includes
% these same reduced individual observations, reductions of the newer
% data taken up until March 2015, and new co-adds and catalogs produced
% from all the data (and using a slightly different calibration
% constant).

\subsection{Outline of paper}

This paper presents first in section \ref{sec:overview} a summary of
the release and the included observations, various overall statistics
and some details on the noise properties of the release. Section
\ref{sec:examples} shows the products produced towards three example
regions (chosen to cover a range of different astronomical
objects). Section \ref{sec:healpix} describes the HEALPix grid used in
this release, and then section \ref{sec:dr} describes our data
reduction procedures. We then describe the calibration of these maps
in section \ref{sec:calib}, including a discussion of some of the more
subtle effects of the data reduction method used. Section
\ref{sec:cat} then describes the emission catalogs. We then finish by
summarizing the pointing offsets found in section \ref{sec:pointing},
and the beam shape in section \ref{sec:beam}.

\section{Overview of Release}
\label{sec:overview}
This release includes publicly-released 850\,\um\ science observations
observed between 2011 February 2 and 2015 March 1, including
observations from calibration projects, PI projects, and the JCMT
Legacy Surveys (JLS). See \citealt{ChrysostomouJLS} for an overview of
the JCMT Legacy Survey program, which included: the Gould Belt Survey
\citep{GBS}, the SCUBA-2 ambitious Sky Survey \citep{SASSy}, the
Cosmology Legacy Survey \citep{Geach2013}, the JCMT Galactic Plane
Survey \citep{JPS}, the Nearby Galaxy Survey ??, and the Debris Disk
Survey \citep{SONS}.  Observations from earlier than 2011 February 2
were not included, as these were taken in \emph{shared risk} mode
while instrument commissioning was still being conducted, and the data
from that era are more problematic \citep{SC19,Dempsey2010}. The first
block of these data, from 2011 to 2013 August 1 (but not including the
CLS) was previously reduced and publicly released in September 2015,
using the same configuration and co-add criteria as described in this
paper, but calibrated using a slightly different flux conversion factor (FCF).



For these observations, we have produced individual reduced
observations, co-adds of all science observations that fell on a given
HEALPix tile, and catalogs of extended contiguous regions and local peaks
detected at $>5\sigma$. Fig.\,\ref{fig:noise-mollweide} shows the all
sky noise map of the co-adds in this release, showing the average RMS
across all valid pixels in a tile as a single square.

All pointing and science observations from our time range, excluding
solar system objects/moving targets, were reduced
using the ORAC-DR recipe \texttt{REDUCE\_SCAN\_JSA\_PUBLIC} onto
HEALPix tiles (see Section \ref{sec:healpix}), using the HPX
projection. These reduced maps are in the instrumental units
of pW (see Section \ref{sec:dr}). The individual-observation maps are available to
download through CADC/the JSA, where they will be listed under their
original project code and metadata. Pointing observations were not
used or analysed further in this data set. We also excluded solar
system objects/moving targets from this release.


All the reduced science observations were individually examined to
determine if they met our quality standards (see Section
\ref{sec:QA}). Co-adds were then made for every HEALPix tile with data
falling onto it, using the PICARD recipe \texttt{COADD\_JSA\_TILES}
(see Section \ref{sec:coadd}), producing a co-added tile calibrated in
units of m\jyas{} (for details of the calibration see
Section~\ref{sec:calib}). For every co-added tile, the PICARD recipe
\texttt{JSA\_CATALOGUE} was then run to produce (if detected) extent
and peak catalogs of detected emission (see Section
\ref{sec:cat}). See Fig.\,\ref{fig:flowchart} for an example of
the flow of data through these recipes.

    as 'BAD' during the Quality Assurance (QA) analysis. Captions

The observations included in this release were each taken in one of
the two different SCUBA-2 standard scan patterns: CV\_DAISY, a
fixed-size scan pattern used for covering small areas, and CURVY\_PONG
scan patterns at various user-chosen sizes, used for covering larger
areas \citep{Holland2013}.  The scanning speed is not the same between
these scan patterns; this will cause some inconsistency in the scales
of emission detected in the reduced maps, as SCUBA-2 observations are
sensitive to different size scales of emission at different
speeds/scan. However, our reduction has been extremely conservative
and has filtered out structure on scales larger than 200\arcsec, so
this difference will be minimized in our co-adds.





\subsection{Overall statistics}

In total, 21464 observations were reduced representing 6420 hours of
observing time, towards 4403 distinct HEALPix tiles. The co-added
observations include 12404 observations (5828 hours or 242.8 days)
towards 4154 tiles. These co-adds were made up of 136 hours of science
calibration observations, 3575 hours of data taken for the JCMT Legacy
Surveys and 2117 hours of data taken for PI projects. This information
is summarized in Table \ref{tab:typesobs}. The co-adds include 1.69
gigapixels of valid data, corresponding to ~1356 square
degrees. %\footnote{\note{1.69e9 * (3.22/(60.0*60.0)**2?}}.
For
comparison, the SCUBA Legacy Catalogue \citep{DiFrancesco2008} covered
19.6 square degrees in their `Fundamental Map Data Set, and 29.3
square degrees in their fuller `Extended Map Data Set'.

Source detection was carried out on all of the co-added tiles, and
this detected emission in 1.37 square degrees (4.17e-4 steradians, or
0.33\% of the area observed.)



Because the observations used here are from a wide variety of projects
aiming for a variety of noise levels, our noise maps are extremely
heterogenous. Figure~\ref{fig:noise-mollweide} shows the all-sky
distribution of the noise maps of our
coadds. Figure~\ref{fig:histonoise} shows a histogram of the noise in
each pixel of the coadded tiles. It can be seen that the most common
noise is 0.35\,m\jyas\ (81\,m\jybm). Table~\ref{tab:noises} shows the area of
our co-adds which has a noise level below various common values. This
is calculated by finding the number of pixels which have a noise value
less than or equal to a given limit. We have given the noise in \jyas\
and Jy\,beam$^{-1}$ using self-derived FCFs (see section
\ref{sec:calib} for details on this
process).

\subsection{The deepest maps}
Twenty of our co-added tiles contain pixels with a noise better than
0.005\,m\jyas{} (corresponding to very roughly 1\,m\jybm). These include
our three most common standard SCUBA-2 calibrators (CRL\,618,
CRL\,2688 and Arp\,220), and several deep cosmology fields that were
observed separately by both the JCMT Cosmology Legacy Survey and by
various PI projects. For reference, these twenty tiles, along with
some statistics of their deep regions are listed in
Table\,\ref{tab:deepmaps}.

\section{Example regions}
\label{sec:examples}
This data release includes emission towards objects covering the full
diversity of non-solar system structures observed by the JCMT --
including dusty disks, complex filamentary molecular clouds, nearby
galaxies, extragalactic point sources, and extremely deep surveys of
standard cosmological fields. Although providing full examples of all
types of emission is beyond the scope of this paper, we here present
some of our co-added tiles covering a range of source types.

\subsection{G034.27+0.15}
The source G034.27+0.15 is a bright, high-mass star-forming region
that has been observed in a wide variety of
wavelengths. Figure~\ref{fig:g34-3} shows our co-added tile, noise map,
extent catalog, and peak catalog towards this source. This co-add
includes data primarily from JCMT calibration projects of this source,
but also two observations from a University of Hawai`i (UH) PI project
(M13AH07B). The noise maps
(Figure~\ref{fig:g34-3}, 2nd figure) for this co-add
shows the characteristic `CV\_DAISY' scan pattern towards the central
source, with two overlapping small PONG observations covering a wider
extent. This field also illustrates the artificially high noise we
see towards bright sources (see Section~\ref{sec:dr}) -- this is seen
in the higher noise points towards the central source and the bright
points in the filament extending towards the top left. Examination of
the extent and peak catalogs, however, (shown below) indicates that
this problem did not prevent a detection of the emission in these
regions. Our experience has been that these high-noise areas only
occur towards bright regions, so they are still clearly detected in
our extent catalogs, with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of $>5$.



% includes a variety of types of structure three examples shown here
% to examine the co-adds and the catalogs.  Includes: filamentary
% region (G34.3), bright point source (CRL~618, a standard calibrator)
% and the deepest map in our data set, a long observation of what is a
% 'blank field in any single observation, but reveals a multitude of
% deep submm galaxies when co-added.

    peaks within the detected extents.}
  \label{fig:g34-3}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{CRL\,618}
CRL\,618 is one of the JCMT's standard flux calibration sources for
SCUBA-2. As such, this co-add includes 923 observations using
51 hours of observing time across the small CV\_DAISY area, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:crl618}. We achieved an extremely low noise due to
this large number of repeats -- achieving a noise better than
0.005\,m\jyas\ around the central source. A zoom in on the central
position shows clearly a variety of point sources detected in this deep
co-add. In addition, it can readily be seen by eye that there appear to
be additional sources that are missed by our cataloging procedure due
to the negative bowling around the very bright source. Horizontal and
vertical cut throughs are shown to help visualise this bowling.

\subsection{Tile\,27258: Deep COSMOS-CANDELS field}
Here we present our deepest map. This includes data both from the JCMT
Cosmology Legacy Survey \citep[recently published by][]{Geach2016} but
also from various University of Hawai`i deep surveys
\citep{Casey2013,Chen2013,Chen2013a}. By being able to include
publicly available data taken by different projects we can achieve a
deeper map than possible with only one data set. Our co-add includes
both wide PONG observations, and very deep DAISY
observations. Figure~\ref{fig:t27258} shows both the entire tile, its
noise map, and also a zoom in of the deepest region. In the noise map
it is possible to see the imprint of the various scan patterns. Note
that we do not appear to have problems with addition of the high noise
edges, indicating that our variance arrays are reasonably accurate
even in these higher noise areas.

In this deep map, it can clearly be seen that there are point sources
spread across the full map. Although for optimal detection of point
sources a beam matched filter should be used, even without using that
we detect a large number of these objects. Figure~\ref{fig:t27258}
shows a comparison of our detections, the CLS's detections from their
first data release \citep{Geach2016} and those of
\citet{Casey2013}. Although these three methods do not detect exactly the
same objects, there are many correspondences between them.

\section{HEALPix grid}
\label{sec:healpix}

To produce a uniform reduction of all public data, it is necessary to
have a suitable scheme for dividing the sky into pre-determined tiles
and pixels to grid the data onto.  The scheme needed to be well
defined in advance, without reference to the position of existing
observations, for consistency and in order to be able to easily
incorporate further data as they become public.  The tiling scheme
which was chosen is that offered by HEALPix \citep[Hierarchical Equal
Area isoLatitude Pixelization,][]{Gorski2005}, commonly used by
cosmologists. The HEALPix system starts by dividing the sky into
twelve facets, and then recursively divides these cells in four at each
higher resolution level.  There are two standard numbering schemes
used with HEALPix, of which the ``nested'' scheme has been used to
label tiles in this release, for convenience with the HPX projection
and compatibility with Virtual Observatory systems such as MOC
\citep[Multi-Order Coverage,][]{2013ASPC..475..135F}.

Pixels within the individual tiles also use the HEALPix grid, which
ensures that the pixelization is continous between each tile and the
adjacent tiles.  This has the advantage that the tiles can be joined
simply by abutting them.  This is done via the HPX projection
\citep{Calabretta2007} which allows the the HEALPix grid to be used
for conventional two-dimensional FITS images.

While HEALPix has the advantage that all pixels have the same area,
the trade off is that the pixels are not all square: they can vary in
width and height while maintaining the constant area.  There are also
discontinuities in the angle of the grid lines at some facet
boundaries.  This is largely a display problem, as although image
viewers with a modern WCS implementation can handle files in the HPX
projection, the grid lines, and therefore astronomical sources also,
will appear bent at these positions.\footnote{If you are concerned by
  the visual appearance of HEALPix maps in your display and wish to
  reassure yourself that any apparent distortion is only due to
  display issues in your image viewer, we would recommend verifying
  the shape and position by contouring the map over a tangent-plane
  map.}

\section{Data reduction}
\label{sec:dr}
SCUBA-2 observations are reduced using the Starlink SMURF program
\texttt{makemap}. In brief, this is an iterative process that divides
the raw data into various instrumental and astronomical signals. There
is an extremely large number of user-adjustable parameters that can
affect the final map, depending on the science goals of the users and
the structure of the astronomical emission observed. For example, a
cosmologist interested in detecting only faint point sources in a
primarily blank map would use a distinctly different set of parameters
from a galactic astronomer looking at bright, extended and
structurally complex emission. For full details on the SCUBA-2 map
maker, please see \citet{Chapin2013}.


%Redraft this paragraph -- more paper-esque.
To guide astronomical users, the JCMT-supported Starlink software
comes with a series of standard configuration files for a variety of
common science cases.
% Although all JCMT observations are run through an automated pipeline
% every night \citep{2011scuba2dr,2015oracdr}, these reductions rely
% on the PI of the project selecting an appropriate reduction `recipe'
% for their science goals.
These standard configuration files can produce very poor results when
used on an inappropriate observation -- for example, the standard
SCUBA-2 configuration file used for calibrator observations is tuned
to expect a bright, compact source at the centre of the map. If used
by mistake on a blank field this recipe could easily create \emph{fake
  emission} in the form of large bloom-like structures. Avoiding this
sort of error was the paramount consideration when selecting the
configuration parameters.

Given the nature of SCUBA-2 data reduction algorithms, the main focus
in developing this \emph{legacy} configuration was on maximising the
confidence that could be placed in detection of emission, at the
expense of not attempting to recover large scale structures.

These observations were reduced using Starlink, Starjava, and ORAC-DR
software developed between versions 2014A and 2015A. Interested
parties seeking to replicate these results can do so by using
the version of the code tagged as `2015A-legacy' in the
Starlink code repositories\footnote{
  https://github.com/Starlink/starlink,\newline
  https://github.com/Starlink/starjava, and \newline
  https://github.com/Starlink/ORAC-DR.}.


\subsection{Details of the legacy DR configuration}
For the exact configuration file used in the legacy reduction see
Appendix~\ref{app:config}. In this particular reduction, after the
initial pre-processing stage, the SCUBA-2 mapmaker recipe performs
five iterations in which the astronomical signal is retained at the
end rather than being removed as in a normal iteration. (This is
specified using \texttt{ast.skip=5}). These initial iterations allow
the reduction process to focus on creating an FLT mask that identifies
any unusually bright region; these regions may cause ringing in
subsequent estimates of the low-frequency noise in each
bolometer. During these iterations ``bright'' pixels are taken to be
those with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 5.0, plus any other
pixels that are attached contiguously to such pixels down to an SNR of
3 (specified by using \texttt{flt.zero\_snr=5} and
\texttt{flt.zero\_snrlo=3}).

During all iterations an atmospheric opacity correction is applied and data
are filtered to remove any features on scales larger than 200\arcsec. In
addition to this a separate common-mode model is produced for each
subarray (specified with \texttt{com.perarray=1}). Having a separate
common-mode estimate per subarray prevents artificial flux (also
known as ``fake blooms'') being introduced into the map where the
common modes vary significantly and are not well represented by a
single common mode. The disadvantage with having a separate common
mode for each subarray is that the reduction is limited to recovering
emission structures that are on the same scale or less than the
subarray size (approximately 200").

After the initial five iterations, the recipe then performs up to 20
further iterations with all the models (specified by
\texttt{numiter=-25}; the initial five iterations plus these additional 20
iterations containing all models). Each of these remaining iterations
removes the astronomical signal from the residuals prior to starting
the next iteration. However, to prevent instabilities in the iterative
process, this subtraction only occurs within regions corresponding to
bright sources.  The mask identifying such sources is created in the
same way as the mask used by the low-frequency noise filter (``FLT''
model): source pixels are taken to be those with a signal-to-noise
ratio greater than 5.0 (plus any other pixels that are attached
contiguously to such pixels down to an SNR of 3 (specified by using
\texttt{ast.zero\_snr=5} and \texttt{ast.zero\_snrlo=3}).

The map maker exits before the 20th iteration if the \texttt{maptol}
parameter -- the change between maps -- has reached a mean value of 1\%
of the noise level (specified by \texttt{maptol=0.01}). For further
detail on the map maker, see \citet{Chapin2013}.



% See Appendix~\ref{app:config} for the full configuration file. Some of
% the most important details are described below:

% Our mapmaker configuration first of all performs five iterations without
% creating an astronomical model of the source. \note{Harriet\&DSB: do
%   we have a short explanation of do we do this again?}. It will then
% perform up to 20 further iterations with all the models, but will exit
% before that point if the 'maptol' parameter has reached a mean value
% of 0.01.

% In order to decrease the production of fake 'blooms' of emission in
% the final map, we produce a separate COMMON mode model for each
% subarray (\texttt{com.perarray=1}). While this produces more reliable
% output (appropriate for this project which has comparatively minimal
% by eye checking of data), it has the effect of removing structure
% scales that are larger than the subarray size.

% \note{zero snr and zero snrlo: need a proper explanation for these}
% We also set the 'AST' and 'FLT' zero\_snr and zero\_snrlo values.

%observation towards a standard calibrator, reduced using both the
%legacy configuration file presented here (in an HPX projection), and

\subsection{Quality Assurance}
\label{sec:QA}

% \subsection{Standard JCMT QA States}
% All observations taken by the JCMT are classified as \status{GOOD}
% (the default), \status{BAD}, \status{QUESTIONABLE}, \status{JUNK} or
% \status{REJECTED}. We included \status{GOOD}, \status{QUESTIONABLE}
% and \status{REJECTED} data in our co-adds. The \status{REJECTED} state
% is used by the JLS teams to indicate that a particular observation did
% not meet their particular QA criterion but the data are otherwise
% usable. The \status{QUESTIONABLE} state was originally designed to be
% a transient state that would be resolved into either \status{BAD} or
% \status{GOOD} after analysis, but in practical terms there was not a
% workflow to ensure this, so some observations have this flag in the
% archive.

% Usually (in the standard nightly reduction pipelines)
% \status{QUESTIONABLE} data is treated as if it is \status{BAD} for the
% purposes of co-adds. However, due to our second QA stage for this
% release, we chose to include it as long as it passed our special
% legacy QA.

% \subsection{Legacy Release QA}
% %Description of process. Examples of observations we threw out.

Every non-pointing reduced file included in this release has been
examined and marked as \status{GOOD}, \status{QUESTIONABLE} or
\status{BAD} by a member of the Legacy Reduction team. This quick
`by-eye' assessment was done by examining an image of the reduced map,
and if necessary following up with more detailed examination. For the
first data release (2011 to 2013, not including the CLS) only used a
map of the emission, and it was found that a lot of questionable
observations required either checking of the tile interactively or the
making of an SNR map. For the second release (observations from 2013
to 2015, and all of the CLS) the QA process also used an image of the
SNR map for the by-eye process, for easier resolution of questionable
observations. \status{BAD} observations were excluded from the
co-adds, as were observations that were flagged as \status{BAD} by the
observatory's normal observation-based QA (usually done during a
night's observing). \status{QUESTIONABLE} observations were examined
further, and either included in the co-adds or changed to
\status{BAD}.


This QA process was designed to avoid: a) `blooms' or `blobs' of fake
emission that can sometimes be produced at the edges of the map by the
mapmaker; and b) to identify the most problematic observations that
had missed being flagged under the telescope standard QA
process.


This sort of process is of course subjective, and some of the
observations that we excluded might be usable on further
examination. However, as with all of this process, the focus for this
release has been to ensure a high-quality release, even at the expense
of completeness. All of the HEALPix-gridded legacy-reduced
observations are available to the community in the JSA, regardless of
our QA analysis of them, so interested users can evaluate the full
available data themselves if they are unhappy with the co-add towards a
tile.


\subsection{Co-adding of tiles}
\label{sec:coadd}
All non-pointing observations for a given tile that passed QA were
co-added and calibrated using the PICARD recipe
\texttt{COADD\_JSA\_TILES}. This uses the \texttt{makemos} routine from
Starlink's \texttt{ccdpack} package \citep[][\ascl{1403.021}]{SUN139}. This
co-adding was carried out as a variance-weighted mean. No despiking
was performed, and no clipping of the noisy edges of observations was
done; no evidence was seen that these were required. The variance map
for the co-added tile is also produced. The calibration from pW into
m\jyas\ was done by multiplying with an FCF of
2.48$\times$10\textsuperscript{3}\,m\jyas\,pW\textsuperscript{$-$1},
derived from our own data set -- see Section \ref{sec:calib}.

\subsection{Source Recovery}
Recently, work by \citet{Mairs2015} examined the recovery of sources
found inside and outside the \texttt{makemap} AST mask, specifically comparing
the JCMT Gould Belt Survey's reductions with the Legacy Release configuration
described here. They found that in SCUBA-2 reductions there is a
significant difference between recovery of sources inside and outside
the AST mask. Sources that are outside the AST-masked regions can have
their flux considerably under-represented. The AST masked region can be
thought of as approximately the region containing detectable emission,
using `detection' limits set by the specific configuration parameters
chosen. The effect is dependent on the size of the source -- extended
sources outside of the masked regions are poorly recovered in this
reduction, whereas point sources are recovered well.  This issue does
in theory affect all reductions, including those using external masks
defined from previous knowledge of the emission, but is of course most
problematic for reductions such as these where the AST mask is defined
based only on detected emission from a single observation.

If users of this release are concerned about the recovery of specific
sources, each individual reduced observation contains a QUALITY array,
indicating which areas of the map were and were not included in
the AST mask (and also the FLT mask).


\subsection{Size Scales}
We have excluded sizes scales larger than the subarray size from our
reduction. In addition, we have used a fairly aggressive large scale
filtering removing scales larger than 200 arcseconds. Interested
readers are directed to \citet{Mairs2015}, which shows some examples
of the same data reduced with the JCMT Gould Belt Survey's reduction
(tuned to recover large scale structure) and with the JCMT-LR
configuration.


\subsection{Negative Bowling}
Within the co-added maps of this release, negative bowling can be
clearly seen around bright sources. Figure~\ref{fig:crl618} shows this
clearly around the bright calibrator CRL\,618. The cut throughs in the
vertical and horizontal direction through the source show the bowling
at ~0.01\,m\jyas. No processing was done to try and ameliorate these
effects, and there will be significant loss of detected emission and
omission of entire sources in the emission catalogs, due to these
artificial negative regions around bright sources.

%\todo{Do we need more examples of this? Find a good description of why
%  this happens, should be in S2 cookbook somewhere.}

\section{Calibration}
\label{sec:calib}


% \begin{itemize}
% \item show images the standard calibrators.
% \item comparison with `standard' calibrator reductions
% %\item effect of pixel size on fluxes. Per, Jess \& Daniel may have
% %  something. Doug J. and GBS did an analysis on this as well.
% \item effect of pointing errors on fluxes.?
% \item PICTURES: calibrators, comparison with bright compact and 1
%   arcsec. Examples of the co-added deep maps of all of our
%   calibrators?.
% \item Beam shape?
% \end{itemize}

The calibration of these data follows (with some changes) the basic
approach used in the standard SCUBA-2 calibration paper
\citep{Dempsey2013}. In brief, a Flux Conversion Factor (FCF) is
derived from observations of standard calibrators of known
brightnesses, which is then used to convert from the instrumental
units of pW into astronomical units. For the JCMT-LR2, an average FCF
was derived for the standard calibration observations taken in our
time period and reduced with the legacy configuration described above.
The reductions of each observation were left in the instrumental pW
units, and the FCF correction was applied to the co-added tiles to
produce units of mJy\,arcsec$^{-2}$. For more information about FCFs
and their derivation, please see \citet{Dempsey2013}.

Three commonly used SCUBA-2 calibrators were analysed when deriving
an appropriate arcsecond FCF for this data set. These are Uranus,
CRL\,618, and CRL\,2688. Note that the Uranus calibration observations
are not part of the standard legacy release themselves, as
observations of moving targets were not included in this release.

\citet{Dempsey2013} used a source aperture radius of 30\arcsec\\ and a
background annulus of radii 45-60\arcsec. They note in their analysis
that this chosen source aperture excluded approximately 8 per cent of
the Uranus flux, and provided a lookup-table of correction factors
(for use when performing aperture photometry with a different source
radius), derived from analysis of the curve-of-growth of a deep Uranus
co-add. We followed their approach by creating deep coadded maps of
our three calibration sources and analysing their curve of growth
(shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cog}) to select appropriate source and
aperture radii. (Note that the data reduction method used in the
original paper was tuned for bright, isolated point sources and forces
a flattening of the map at radii larger than 60\arcsec, which is not
done on our more general purpose data reduction method.) Based on
these plots, we selected a source radius of 60\arcsec\ (chosen to
avoid much of the negative bowling seen around CRL 618 and CRL 2688,
while not missing too much of the flux from Uranus, which extends out
further), and a background annulus from 105-120\arcsec\ (chosen to
avoid the ringing structure detected in the deep coadds).

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{cog-relative60arcs.pdf}
  \caption{The curve-of-growth for the deep coadded maps of Uranus,
    CRL\,618 and CRL\,2688. The top plot shows all flux included
    within a radius of the given size, normalised to the flux for that
    source in an aperture of 60" radius. The bottom plot shows the
    average flux per pixel in an annulus at the given radii,
    normalised to the flux in the first annulus. The 60\arcsec\ radius
    and the 105-120\arcsec background annulus used in the aperture
    photometry(AP) FCF derivation are indicated on the plot.}
  \label{fig:cog}
\end{figure}



Using these apertures, an arcsecond FCF was then derived for the
JCMT-LR2 850\,\micron\ reduction of each calibration observation
towards these three sources.\footnote{CRL 618 and CRL 2688
  Observations that had been marked as poor quality during QA were not
  included in the following analysis.}  The Uranus observations from
the time period covered by this release had been separately reduced
using the same SCUBA-2 configuration and pixel size, but not onto a
HEALPix grid due to being a moving target. The maps were masked with
the appropriate circles/annulus and the source and background
statistics were calculated using the ATOOLS and KAPPA Starlink
packages. The KAPPA command \texttt{beamfit} was also used to fit the
amplitude of the beam, and this was used to generate the per-beam
FCF. The Starlink FLUXES package was used to derived the expected flux
of Uranus at the time of each observation. For CRL\,618 and CRL\,2688,
the integrated and beam flux from \citet{Dempsey2013} was
used.\footnote{The autoastrom command does not account for non-square
  pixels, so was not used for this analysis.}

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  \mathrm{FCF_{arcsec}} = \frac{S_{\mathrm{integ}}}{I_{0}A}\ \mathrm{Jy\,pW^{-1}\,arcsec^{-2}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:2}
  \mathrm{FCF_{beam}} = \frac{S_{\mathrm{peak}}}{I_{\mathrm{peak}}}\ \mathrm{Jy\,pW^{-1}\,beam^{-1}}
\end{equation}

Where $S_{integ}$ is the known integrated flux in the source and
$S_{peak}$ is the known peak flux in the source (both from FLUXES for
Uranus, or from \citet{Dempsey2013}), $I_{0}$ is the summed flux in
the aperture of the map (minus the flux in the background aperture),
$I_{peak}$ is the peak amplitude of the BEAMFIT Gaussian fit to the
map, and $A$ is the area of a pixel in the map
($3.22^2\,\textrm{arcsec}^{2}$).

    sigma clipped mean for each source is shown as the vertical line,
    and the horizontal cross bar indicates the $\pm$ one standard
    deviation.}

\subsection{Effect of AST masking on derived FCF}

The recovery of source emission in SCUBA-2 observations reduced with
\texttt{makemap} is strongly dependent on the exact details of the AST
mask used in the reduction (unless an AST model is not
used). \citet{Mairs2015} looked in some detail at a comparison between
the recovery in flux of sources inside and outside the AST mask, for
the JCMT-LR makemap configuration. They found from simulations that
the flux in sources outside the mask is suppressed compared to the
'true' value, and compared to sources inside the mask. In this
reduction we use an auto-generated AST mask that finds sources with a
5-$\sigma$ detection at each iteration (and follows them down to a
3-$\sigma$ limit); this means that our AST mask, and hence flux
recovery, is dependent on the brightness of the sources and the noise
in the observation.


This has an important, but often ignored, effect on the flux recovery
and derived FCFs from our calibration observations; very bright
sources, such as Uranus, will have a larger area included in the AST
mask due to a higher signal-to-noise at a given RMS, when compared
with dimmer sources such as CRL\,618 and CRL\,2688. We believe this
variation in the AST model size causes the very different curves of
growth for Uranus as opposed to CRL\,618 and CRL\,2688 (see figure
\ref{fig:cog}). We believe this is also responsible for the difference
in the arcsecond FCF mean values for Uranus -- not a dramatic
difference with the 60\arcsec\ source aperture used here, but more
obvious at some aperture sizes.  For reference, Uranus has an
integrated flux between 57.2 and 70.3 Jy for the observations in this
analysis (from FLUXES), whereas CRL\,618 has a flux of 5.0 Jy, and
CRl\,2688 has a similar flux of 6.13\,Jy \citep[both
from][]{Dempsey2013}.

% The issue occurs due to the effect of the automatic AST masking used
% in the data reduction, combined with the extreme variation in the
% source brightnesses. In our configuration, an AST mask is produced
% each iteration around every source with an SNR peak greater than 5,
% and followed down to include all connecting pixels with an SNR greater
% than 3. If we compare the three calibration sources Uranus, CRL 618,
% and CRL 2688, these sources have significantly different
% brightnesses. CRL\,618 has an integrated flux of 5.0 Jy, CRL\,2688 is
% 6.13 Jy, whereas Uranus varies between 57.2 and 70.3 Jy for the
% observations in this analysis.

Therefore, for an observation reaching a similar noise level in the
map, the auto-generated AST mask will have a different size for each
source (based on their brightness -- see figure
\ref{fig:astmask}). This will then cause different proportions of the
flux in the source to be recovered in the final map, due to the
differing recovery in \texttt{makemap} reductions of flux within and
without the beam.

As a result, when performing aperture photometry at a specific source
aperture, different proportions of the `true' total source flux will
be found for sources of different brightnesses. This will cause a
measurable difference in the measured FCF for the sources when using a
constant aperture. In particular, Uranus observations have a much
larger AST mask, and thus will have a higher proportion of their total
integrated flux found at a specific aperture. This leads to a
derivation of a smaller FCF for Uranus than for the dimmer calibration
sources.

This affect would not be seen in the `canonical' analysis presented in
Dempsey et al 2013, as the \texttt{makemap} \texttt{bright\_compact}
configuration used there sets a fixed AST aperture with a radius
of 60\arcsec\ for all sources, constraining all pixels beyond this
radius to zero until the last iteration.


To illustrate this problem visually, we have simulated a set of point
sources at various peak brightnesses (in pW) from 0.002 pW to 0.1 pW,
and reduced them using the \texttt{jsa\_generic} configuration. This
roughly goes from a quarter of the peak intensity of CRL\,618 (which
has an average peak brightness of 0.009 pW in these observations)
to roughly the brightness of Uranus (an average peak of 0.11
pW).These maps were created using the \texttt{fakemap} and
\texttt{fakescale} options to \texttt{makemap}, with a source model
taken from the central 200x200 pixel square found in a deep coadd of
800 Uranus observations, and using a single blank Daisy observation
for the SCUBA-2 data. Figure~\ref{fig:simulation} shows the variation
in source brightness and relative derived FCF for a variety of
different source and background apertures. For reference,
figure~\ref{fig:astmask} shows the relationship between the area of
the AST mask with the brightness of the simulated source.

\subsubsection{Effect of transmission}
Due to the signal-to-noise limits in the AST masking, there will also
be a similar systematic effect in the measured FCF of a calibration
due to the RMS noise in the observation. Higher noise observations
will have a smaller area in their SNR-defined AST mask, and thus a
higher FCF will be calculated. As the major determiner of the noise is
the 850\,\um\ transmission of the observation, this will lead to a
variation in derived FCF with both weather and elevation. Figure
\ref{fig:fcfairmass} shows the derived arcsecond FCFs plotted against
the 850\,\um\ transmission. A slight trend can clearly by seen. For
comparison, we also give the variation in derived arcsecond FCFs with
time. No correction to the FCF for sky opacity or date was made in
this release.

    be seen between FCF and the transmission of the observation. Some
    extreme outliers have been cropped from the plots.}
  \label{fig:fcfairmass}
\end{figure}



\hl{Please note that there is an additional complication here, in that the
autogenerated AST mask actually varies in area \emph{at each
  iteration}.}

\subsection{Derivation of mean FCF}
Despite the larger systematic uncertainty from the AST masking
effects, we have still chosen here to calibrate this data release
using a single FCF number. With Uranus being far brighter than anything
in our source emission, we have chosen to only use CRL\,618 and
CRL\,2688 to derive our FCF value. We used the derived FCF from each
calibration observation described above, then applied an iterative
clipping which excludes FCF values 5-$\sigma$ away from the mean (as
extreme outliers will often be due to poor instrumental performance,
bad weather, day time observing or other affects that are not present
in the bulk of the released data.) Figure \ref{fig:fcfhist} shows
histograms of the full distributions for each source. The final
average values found are:

\begin{eqnarray}
\mathrm{FCF}_{\mathrm{arcsec},850}&=&2.46 \pm 0.22\ \mathrm{Jy}\ \mathrm{pW}^{-1}\  \mathrm{arcsec}^{-2}.\\
\mathrm{FCF}_{\mathrm{beam},850}&=&571 \pm 48\ \mathrm{Jy}\ \mathrm{pW}^{-1}\ \mathrm{beam}^{-1}.
\end{eqnarray}

% \begin{figure}
%   \centering
%   \includegraphics{lrvalues-histo}
%   \caption{Histogram of FCFs, both for all sources (light gray) and
%     separately for each source. The derived average FCF is shown as
%     the dashed vertical line, with the $\pm$1s.d. shown as the light
%     gray lines to either side.}
%   \label{fig:calibhist}
% \end{figure}

The co-adds in this release were calibrated using this mean arcsecond
FCF.  This standard deviation represents a 1-$\sigma$ uncertainty of
approximately 9 percent. All co-adds were calibrated using the same
FCF. If it is wished to undo the calibration and redo with a different
value, please simply divide the data set by this FCF, and then
recalibrate using the FCF of your choice. Similarly, this can be done
with any flux values quoted in the catalogs derived from the
co-adds.

The standard deviation of the sample of derived FCFs represents the
minimum uncertainty in this calibration. In addition, we should take
into account the standard error in the sub-mm flux of
Uranus. \citet{Dempsey2013} quote this as $\pm$ 5 percent. Taken
together in quadrature, this gives an overall estimated error of
$\pm$10 percent.

For comparison, the usual `canonical' 850\,\micron\ arcsecond FCF used
in the JCMT's nightly reductions is $2.34 \pm 0.08 \mathrm{Jy}\
\mathrm{pW}^{-1}\ \mathrm{arcsec}^{-2}$ \citep{Dempsey2013}. This is
approximately 3 percent lower than the value used here, and was
derived using the `bright compact' \texttt{makemap} configuration on 1
arcsecond pixels (in comparison with the 3.22$\times$3.22 arcsecond
pixels in this release), using observations taken from 2011 to
20XX.

% Don't care that much about comparison with the legacy FCF?

%Fig.\,\ref{fig:lr-caldb-histo} shows the comparison between the
%histograms of bright compact derived FCFs and the legacy release
%derived histogram, for the same
%observations. Fig.\,\ref{fig:lr-caldb-scatter} shows the scatter plot
%of each bright compact FCF vs the legacy release FCF for each
%observation. Broadly speaking, we see an approximately linear
%relationship between the two derivations of FCF.

% \begin{figure}

%   calibrating the legacy release (2.48) and the canonical FCF (2.34)

% \end{figure}

% \subsection{Effect of AST masking on the source calibration}
% As can be seen from figure\ref{fig:calibhist}, we appear to see
% different distributions of derived arcsecond FCFs for Uranus as
% compared with CRL 618 \& CRL 2668. We believe this is due to the
% difference in brightnesses in the source, when combined with the AST
% masks produced in the reductions. In our configuration, an AST mask is
% produced each iteration around every source with an SNR peak greater
% than 5, and followed down to include all connecting pixels with an SNR
% greater than 3.

% The recovery of source emission in SCUBA-2 observations reduced with
% \texttt{makemap} is strongly dependent on the exact details of the AST
% mask used in the reduction (unless an AST model is not used). See
% e.g. Mairs et al 2016 for detailed discussion of this effect when
% comparing the brightness of sources found inside and outside the AST
% region. However, as well as the effect on faint sources found outside
% the AST mask, it is important to note that the AST model will also
% have an effect on our derivation of arcsecond Flux Calibration Factors
% using aperture photometry.

% If we compare the three calibration sources Uranus, CRL 618, and CRL
% 2688, these sources have significantly different brightnesses. This
% means that for an observation reaching a similar noise level in the
% map, the auto-generated 3-sigma AST mask will include differing areas
% of the map for each source (based on their brightness). This will then
% cause different proportions of the flux in the source to be recovered
% in the final map, due to the differing recovery in \texttt{makemap}
% reductions of flux within and without the beam.

% %(You could consider this difference in area as almost corresponding to
% %probing a different proportion of the JCMT/SCUBA-2 beam, in an
% %observation of the same noise level.)



% Therefore, when performing aperture photometry at a specific source
% aperture, different proportions of the `true' total source flux will
% be found for sources of different brightnesses. Effectively, this will
% cause a measurable difference in the FCF for the sources. In
% particular, Uranus (ranging in brightness between 57 and 70 Jy) will have
% a larger AST mask, and thus will have a higher proportion of its
% 'true' integrated flux found at a specific aperture. This will lead to
% a derivation of a smaller FCF for Uranus than for the dimmer
% calibration sources.

% This affect would not be seen in the `canonical' analysis presented
% in Dempsey et al 2013, as the \texttt{bright\_compact} configuration in
% that analysis uses  a fixed AST aperture with a radius of 60\arcsec\ for all
% sources, constraining all pixels beyond this radius to zero until the
% last iteration.

% To help visualise this effect, we present in in
% Figure \ref{fig:astmasks} a comparison of the areas included in the AST
% masks found by source. It can be seen that the AST mask for Uranus, by
% far the brightest source, covers a significantly larger area than that
% of the CRL 618 and CRL 2688 sources.

% To illustrate this further, we have simulated a set of point sources
% at various brightnesses (in pW) from 0.002 pW to 0.1 pW, and reduced
% them using the \texttt{jsa\_generic} configuration. These maps were
% created using the \texttt{fakemap} and \texttt{fakescale} options to
% \texttt{makemap}, with a source model taken from the central 200x200
% pixel square found in a deep coadd of 800 Uranus observations, and
% using a single blank Daisy observation for the SCUBA-2
% data. Figure~\ref{fig:simulation} shows the variation in source
% brightness and relative derived FCF for a variety of different source
% and background apertures.


% Please note that there is an additional complication here, in that the
% autogenerated AST mask actually varies in area \emph{at each iteration}.

\subsection{Effect on catalogue fluxes.}

\citet{Dempsey2013} derived appropriate FCFs for either point sources
or for circular aperture photometry, and we have followed their
approach here. However, it is clear that for the arbitrary shaped
regions of emission found in the catalogs of this release, it would
not be appropriate to perform circular aperture photometry, and as
discussed above this would also not be sufficient to correct for the
different proportions of flux included inside the AST mask.

As such, we simply present the integrated and peak flux found within
our sources, calibrated using the arcsecond FCF derived for CRL 618
and CRL 2688 using aperture photometry, without attempting to correct
for these effects or subtract any backgrounds. In practise, it should
be assumed that there is an additional significant (and not completely
known) uncertainty on fluxes presented here, or indeed on any flux
found by simple integration of flux found within an arbitrary
shape. From our analysis of simulations of point sources above, it is
likely that there are systematic trends where lower flux is more
poorly recovered than brighter flux. If highly accurate integrated
fluxes are required, it may be necessary to perform detailed
simulations investigating the total flux recovery for a given AST
mask. We would also recommend users of this release interested in
highly accurate fluxes investigate the AST mask found for the
individual observations that went into each mosaiced tile.









\section{Catalogs}
\label{sec:cat}
The JCMT Legacy Release includes emission catalogs generated from
each of the co-added maps. As we have an extremely diverse set of
astronomical regions (including blank fields, point sources, and large
complex extended structures), we did not feel it would be possible to
perform specific astronomical source finding and
classification. Instead, this release focused on identifying first of
all \emph{regions of contiguous emission}, discussed here as
\emph{extents}, and secondly on \emph{identifying local maxima within
those regions}, described here as \emph{peaks}. The primary goal of
these catalogs is to provide astronomers with regions of securely
detected emission.


We have chosen to use the FellWalker algorithm \citep{Berry2015}, as
implemented in the Starlink \texttt{cupid} \citep{cupid} package for this
analysis. Unlike the more commonly used ClumpFind, which simply lays
discrete contour levels on the map and uses those to identify regions,
FellWalker follows lines of ascent within the map to identify all
peaks of emission. We have found it to be robust and
easy-to-understand, and to produce intelligible results.

\subsection{Extents}
\label{sec:extents}
We have identified the regions of contiguous extended emission within
each tile by looking at the signal-to-noise maps of the co-added
tiles. We chose to consider all regions of contiguous emission
containing a pixel brighter than 5-$\sigma$, followed down to a limit
of 3-$\sigma$, to be a single `extent' for purposes of our catalogs,
if the region is larger in area than a beam.  Here, a very simple
approximation of the beam was used: all sources comprising more than
nine pixels were kept. We considered using a more complex approach,
but noise spikes did not appear to be commonly falsely detected as
emission with this approach. The main source of false detections in
our reductions \emph{would} have been the previously discussed problem of
`false blooms', if we had not used a by-eye approach for flagging the
handful of problematic reductions and removing them from the co-adds.

The reduced observations, produced by SMURF's \texttt{makemap} routine, all
contain a variance array giving a noise estimate for each pixel, based on
the scatter of input data values to that pixel. Pixels with too few
inputs to calculate a variance point are not included in
the individual maps. Our co-adding procedure uses this variance to
weight the input observations.

We used the FellWalker algorithm as implemented in \texttt{cupid} on
an SNR map to produce contiguous regions of emission and to identify
the position of the peak pixel within each map, and these outlines are
available both as a FITS format mask file, as a HEALPix
Multi-Order Coverage file (MOC), and as a rough approximation by STC-S
polygon. The catalog for each tile indicates the ID of the clump, the
RA and Dec of the peak pixel, the total flux contained within the
entire extent, the flux of the peak pixel, and the area of the entire
extent. The catalog also includes the approximation of the outline of
the extent as an STC-S polygon string. An excerpt from the extent
catalog for Tile\,30318 (containing G34.3) is shown in
Table~\ref{tab:extents}.







\subsection{Peaks}
\label{sec:peaks}
In order to provide some information about the nature of emission
within the extents, this release includes identification of local
maxima within the extents. \emph{It is important to note that these
  should not in general be considered as point sources.} We identified
these maxima by running the FellWalker algorithm (from \texttt{CUPID})
on the regions we had previously identified as being in
\emph{extents}. The peak detections were not created from the SNR map,
as we could assume by only looking within the detected extents that we
were already looking at detected emission.

As our maps contain a varying noise, we used the mean noise across the
entire detected extent as a representative noise. We then used the
FellWalker algorithm with that noise as the RMS value, and identified
as individual local maxima those which contained a peak of 5-$\sigma$,
followed down to a noise level of 3-$\sigma$, and with at least a
5-$\sigma$ dip between them and neighbouring maxima. Our output
catalog contains the ID of the peak, the RA and Dec of the peak
pixel, the flux in the peak pixel, and the ID of the extent the peak
was found within. An excerpt from the peak catalog for Tile\,30318 is
shown in Table~\ref{tab:peaks}.

We decided not to include the outlines of all emission counted as
being within that object or clump, as we felt that would encourage
users to consider the peaks as being discrete physical objects. Although
they may be in some cases, in many other cases the peak is simply a
local maxima within a complex molecular cloud. The `clump outlines'
produced by software such as \texttt{cupid} always reflect the arbitrarily
chosen boundaries of dips and minimum heights, and should not be
assumed to represent physical objects without considerable further
modelling.


%\footnote{To re-grid one or more HEALPix tiles onto a standard RA-Dec
%  projection, the Starlink \textsc{smurf} command \texttt{jsajoin} can
%  be used \citep[][\ascl{1310.007}]{SUN258}.}



% \section{Noise}

% % co-adds contain 1.69 gigapixels of non bad data.
% %
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Noise maps: overlaps work fine, show an example?
% \item Copy COHRS pixel distribution graph?
% \item noise on each pixel, noise vs integration time.
% \item High noise towards bright sources.
% \end{itemize}




%Noise vs integration time
% this is harder to do -- how to do a scatter plot of with billions of
% points.. 2-d histogram instead? produce in same way as the noise
% co-adds.

% Anomalous variance array values towards bright sources USe OMC-1 and
% CRL 618 as examples? Also visible in G34.3 shown earlier. Mentioned
% earlier.

\section{Pointing}
\label{sec:pointing}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{pointing-offset.pdf}
  \caption{Histogram of the total magnitude of the position offsets
    found in the JCMTCAL observations (including pointings). The
    median value of 2.88\arcsec{} is indicated on the plot.}
  \label{fig:pointing}
\end{figure}

% explain the position fudging done for the calibration sources.
Our observations of JCMT standard calibrators and pointing sources are
corrected for normal pointing offsets, as these sources are all at
known positions. In our data reduction stage, these observations are
run through \texttt{makemap} twice; first to calculate the difference between
the beam position and the known source position, and secondly
re-reduced using this positional offset to place the observation at
the correct point. No other observations in this data set were
corrected for their positions.


The JCMT usually quotes a pointing offset of approximately 2\arcsec{}
in $x$ and $y$ (\emph{private communication, Dr Iain Coulson}),
corresponding to an average radial offset of 2.9\arcsec{}. By
examining the offsets in RA and Dec found for the calibrator and
pointing observations, we identified that the average pointing offset
for the release matches this expected value, with a median radial
offset of 2.86\arcsec{}. See Figure~\ref{fig:pointing} for the
histogram of these offsets. We assume that the pointing in our
non-calibration observations should follow the same distribution. When
looking at science observations, a correction factor for beam smearing
should be included in the resolution.


\section{Beamshape}
\label{sec:beam}

Using the same deep coadded maps of Uranus as we examined in Section
\ref{sec:calib}, we fit a two-component beam model to the JCMT
beamshape, and found the same shape and size as found in
\citet{Dempsey2013}. We use the KAPPA command \texttt{beamfit} to do
this, fitting two circular Gaussians with a fixed background level of
0. We found FWHM of 12.55\arcsec\ and 44\arcsec\, with a relative
amplitude of 96 percent and 4 percent. Figure \ref{fig:beam} shows the
image of the deep Uranus co-added maps, as well as a comparison
between the radial profiles along the horizontal and vertical axes and
the fitted beam shape.
