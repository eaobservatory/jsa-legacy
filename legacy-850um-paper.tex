\begin{abstract}
  % Re write this properly once the rest of the paper is written.
  The JCMT Science archive allows access to raw and reduced data for
  all publicly available JCMT observations. To aid users of JCMT
  products, we have produced a standardised reduction of public JCMT
  SCUBA-2 850\micron SCUBA-2 observations. These reductions provide
  uniformly reduced coadds of of all data that was public as of August
  1st 2014, and catalogues to identify the regions where emission was
  detected. The data have been gridded in the HEALPix HPX scheme.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item Description of the JSA \citep{2015Economou}
\item Very brief description of heterodyne and SCUBA-2 instruments, cite instrument papers. \citep{2013MNRAS.430.2513H} \citep{2009MNRAS.399.1026B}
\item Outline of the advanced data products. \citep{2014SPIE.9152E..2JB}
\item Historical perspective. \citep{2011ASPC..442..203E}
\item ongoing plans -- dynamic archive, continually updated etc.
\end{itemize}



\section{HEALPix grid }
Require a fixed tiling and grid to reduce our data onto, as we want to be able to
incorporate all data current and future into this method. The chosen
grid is that of the HEALPix method (Hierarchical Equal Area
isoLatitude pixelation), commonly used in cosmological fields. This
has the advantage that all pixels have the same area. The trade off is
that the pixels do not have the same size in RA and Dec.

  disadvantages}

\footnote{To re-grid a HEALPix tile onto a standard RA-Dec projection,
the Starlink \textsc{smurf} command \texttt{jsajoin} can be used \citep{SUN258}.}

\section{Grouping, reducing and coadding observations}
Describe the basic flow chart (and illustrate) for JSA advanced data
products (obs product reductions, grouping, coadd, cataloges, and
similar but with some co-reductions and frequency regridding for
HARP).

Full description of how the observations are grouped into
associations.



\subsection{SCUBA-2 reduction configuration}

\begin{itemize}
\item Brief description of how SCUBA-2 data reduction works.
\item mapmaker paper: \citep{2013MNRAS.430.2545C}
\item Details of our chosen configuration and why we chose it. (detailed).
\item Examples of some reduced maps.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{QA}

\subsubsection{Standard JCMT QA States}
All observations taken by the JCMT are classified as 'GOOD' (the
default), 'BAD', 'QUESTIONABLE', 'JUNK' or 'REJECTED'. We included
GOOD, QUESTIONABLE and REJECTED data in our co-adds. The QUESTIONABLE
state was originally designed to be a transient state that would be
resolved into either BAD or GOOD after analysis, but in practical
terms there was not a work flow to ensure this, so some observations
have this flag in the archive.

Usually (in the standard nightly reduction pipelines) QUESTIONABLE
data is treated as if it is BAD for the purposes of co-adds. However,
due to our second QA stage for this release, we chose to include it as
long as it passed our special legacy QA

\subsubsection{Legacy Release QA}
%Description of process. Examples of observations we threw out.

Every reduced file included in this has been marked as GOOD by a
member of the JAC team. This quick 'by-eye' assessment was simply done
on a image of the reduced map. This QA process was designed to avoid:
a) `blooms' or `blobs' of fake emission that can sometimes be produced
at the edges of the map by the mapmaker.  b) identify the most
problematic observations that had missed being flagged under the
telescope standard QA process.

This sort of process is of course subjective, and some of the
observations that we excluded might turn out fine on further
examination. However, as with all of this process, the focus for this
release has been to pursue ensure a high quality, even at the expense
of completeness. All of the HEALPix-gridded legacy-reduced
observations are available to the community in the JSA, regardless of
our QA analysis of them.





\subsection{Co-adding}
Brief?
\begin{itemize}
\item Do we include anything to cope with hot pixels etc.
\end{itemize}



\section{Calibration}
\begin{itemize}
\item Calibration paper \citep{2013MNRAS.430.2534D}
\item show images the standard calibrators.
\item comparison with 'standard' calibrator reductions
\item effect of pixel size on fluxes.
\item effect of pointing errors on fluxes.
\item Our uncertainty in the final flux.
\end{itemize}


We calibrated our data into units of mJy per arc-second squared.
As the effective beam size is increased during the co-add procedure
(due to errors in the pointing between different maps), and the choice
of pixel size can also affect the beam, we have chosen not to try and
calibrate into units of the beam.


\section{Bowling}
Examples of the bowling in our maps.

\section{Noise}
\begin{itemize}
\item Analysis of the noise maps, how believable they are.
\item High noise towards bright sources.
\end{itemize}



\section{Catalogues}
\begin{itemize}
\item Fellwalker! \citep{2015A&C....10...22B}
\item Island and peak paradigm overview.
\item Details of our chosen parameters
\item Cross referencing between neighbouring tiles.
\end{itemize}

\section{Mapmaker configuration}
The mapmaker configuration used for this release (known as a
\texttt{dimmconfig}) is shown here. Like most SCUBA-2 mapmaker
configuration files, it first sources the \emph{base}
\texttt{dimmconfig} file that sets up the basic values for a range of
options and then tweaks a subset of additional parameters or its
purposes. This file is shipped in the 2015A Starlink release. The
value of every configuration parameter used is written into the
history component of the file.

\begin{verbatim}
